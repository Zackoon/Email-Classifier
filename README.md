# Email-Classifier
Welcome! This is my first attempt at an email classifier using some of 
the skills I learned this summer. Starting a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/spam-mails-dataset?resource=download)
of spam and normal emails, here's the process I went through: 


1. Determining The Goal
2. Loading and Cleaning Data
3. Training/Test Split
4. Feature Engineering
5. EDA and Basic Classification
6. Feature Selection Process
7. Evaluating Which Words to Look For
8. Getting Rid of Correlated Features
9. K-Fold Cross Validation
10. Features Besides Just Words
11. The Final (Logistic Regression) Model
12. Visualizations
13. ROC Curve
14. Test Predictions
